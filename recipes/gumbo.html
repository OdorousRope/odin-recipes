    <h3>The Best Gumbo Around</h3>
    <p>This is a favourite dish of mine and the best gumbo if you have the time to make it.  This gumbo is a bit different in how the roux is made.  Traditionally a roux is flour that is browned in butter or oil.  In this case, we will be doing just that but with the added step of frying chicken.</p>

    <ul><h4>Ingredients</h4>
     <li>1 1⁄4 cups plus 2 tbsp. canola oil</li>
     <li>1 (3 1/2–4 lb.) chicken, cut into 8 pieces</li>
     <li>2 1⁄2 tsp. freshly ground black pepper</li>
     <li>Kosher salt, to taste</li>
     <li>2 cups flour</li>
     <li>1 1⁄2 tsp. dark chile powder</li>
     <li>1 1⁄2 tsp. filé powder</li>
     <li>1 tsp. cayenne</li>
     <li>1 tsp. ground white pepper</li>
     <li>1 tsp. paprika</li>
     <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
     <li>3 stalks celery, minced</li>
     <li>1 green bell pepper, minced</li>
     <li>1 jalapeño, minced</li>
     <li>1 poblano pepper, minced</li>
     <li>1 yellow onion, minced</li>
     <li>12 cups chicken stock</li>
     <li>1 lb. andouille, halved and sliced</li>
     <li>12 oz. okra, trimmed and sliced 1/2" thick</li>
     <li>Sliced scallions, for garnish</li>
     <li>Cooked white rice, for serving</li>
    </ul>
     
    <ol><h4>Instructions</h4>
     <li>Heat 1 1⁄4 cups oil in an 8-qt. Dutch oven until a deep-fry thermometer reads 350°. Season chicken with 1 tsp. black pepper and salt; toss with 1⁄2 cup flour. Working in batches, fry chicken until golden; transfer to paper towels to drain.</li>
     <li>Add remaining flour to Dutch oven; whisk until smooth. Reduce heat to medium-low; cook, whisking, until color of roux is dark chocolate, 1–1 1⁄2 hours. Add remaining black pepper, the chile and filé powders, cayenne, white pepper, paprika, garlic, celery, bell pepper, jalapeño, poblano, and onion; cook until soft, 10–12 minutes. Add stock; boil. Reduce heat to medium-low; cook, stirring occasionally and skimming fat as needed, until slightly thickened, about 30 minutes. Add reserved chicken; cook until chicken is cooked through, about 45 minutes. Add andouille; cook until chicken is falling off the bone, about 1 hour.</li>
     <li>Using tongs, transfer chicken to a cutting board and let cool slightly; shred, discarding skin and bones, and return to pot. Heat remaining oil in a 12" skillet over medium-high. Cook okra until golden brown and slightly crisp, 8–10 minutes, then stir into gumbo; cook 15 minutes. Garnish with scallions; serve with rice.</li>
